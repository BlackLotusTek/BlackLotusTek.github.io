## This is my first blog post

This is the first blog post of many hopefully.
Like I have mentioned before I am making this to document my learnings in the IT field.

While I am unsure of the formatting luckily I am sure of the content so even though this may not be the most
readable content at least the content itself will (with some luck) be worth while.

Since this is the first post it would probably be best that I catch everyone up on where we are at so far.

In TheBeginning, I started to consider making IT a career in January of 2023 when I was working overnight at a print job I held.
I had always been fairly savy with computers and spent most of my days playing video games and even going as far to build
my own computer when I was around 16 in high school. Along with that over the years with my gaming friends I became the go to 
person if someone was in need of a hardware upgrade recommendation as I tended to stay up to date on what seemed to be the better
choice when it came to gaming and I even took price to performance into account.

As far as study goes I have never had a mentor per say and only my intuition to guide me on what is the best way to move forward 
on this path of becoming an IT professional. The only people I really had to look to was a couple of gaming friends that lived
in a different state that worked for their local government doing work in the IT field. I had let them know my preliminary plan of
beginning to study for the CompTIA Security +. I figured that I was already fairly aware of the content in the more beginner
certifications and I could probably skip ahead a little. 

I was wrong. I immediately felt in over my head, but even so I ended up finishing the CompTIA Security+ study guide book and knew that
I was not going to be ready. Whether I was or was not didn't matter because mentally I was not confident and didn't want to risk throwing
$300+ in the trash if my first plunge into the certification track went worse than expected. So if a dose of reality I realigned my
efforts and began studying in earnest for the CompTIA A+.

By this time I had left my last overnight job which was a nice breath of fresh air being able to operate during the day like a normal person
and with this new position I became more invigorated to study. My new position gave me access to a full library of digital books and video 
learning materials to indulge in to further solidify my knowledge for the A+. I started the new position in May and it has already been
a few months of studying when I can while maintaining relationships and a full time job. So I tended to study after work or in the early
hours of the morning. I was able to secure two discounted CompTIA A+ vouchers and took them in relatively quick succession which was
roughly within two weeks of each other. Scoring a 741 for part one and the exact same score for part two was more than enough to say
that on August 19, 2024 I was CompTIA A+ certified.

I never really celebrated but I felt good and even to this day I am unsure if I was more happy to have passed on an early Saturday
morning at my house, having taken the exam through their online portal, or that nothing going wrong after reading all of the horror
stories of exam proctors failing test takers for seemingly no reason. Either way I was happy but it was bitter sweet knowing that this
was just the beginning and really ment that I had more work laying in front of me as the journey continued. 

Soon after I realigned myself and began relearning the material for the CompTIA Security+ and this felt much more daunting and 
the A+ ever could. I studied more than I would have imagined studying while I worked through audiobooks, youtube videos, and anything 
that seemed like study material so I could soak in more while I worked. I studied when I got home from work until I went to bed early
only to wake up in the wee hours, nearly 4AM just so that I would have a good few hours of quiet to study alone and focus soley on
passing the exam.I knew that I was ready for roughly two weeks but I couldn't pull the trigger on scheduling the exam as this was
far more expensive than the A+. Finally I bit down and scheduled an in person test at the local college and even took the day off 
to spend 5 hours studying before hand. I remember when I finished the finishing survey and saw my score of 780 I fist pumped the air
with both my hands and for a brief moment put my head in my hands nearly at tears for how overjoyed I felt for all the hard work to
have paid off.

Since then I took the holidays off and sadly to admit took quiet a bit more time off than I had ever wanted so that leads us to just a few 
weeks ago. While actively looking for positions to utilize my newly minted Security+ certificate I decided that all of this is not something
that I want to be an isolated event. By that I mean that I am planning on continuing to study and learn certificates. This doesn't mean
I put a lot of stock in certifcations or that I want to get as many as possible but that this is a great way for me to keep track of things
that I want to pursue for better knowledge of the IT field that I am so interested in and it lends some structure to further learnings.

All of this to say that I am going to be using this blog to document my journey of learning the Cisco CCNA which is the next certification that
is in my sights. I am taking the study slow and steady; making sure to learning in the cracks of the day which is still the mornings, at work, 
and even at night but not as voraciously as I once had. The goal now is not to get the certification but to gain the knowledge and picking up
the certification on the way. To become the best that I possibly can in the field that I persue and bring to bear all of the knowledge that I
have built up over the many days and nights. I already know what I plan to talk about next but I figured we would start with the heros
origin story before we get into the actual documentation just so that we are all caught up and have a reference for if some poor soul asks how
I got into this I can direct them to this sad excuse of a blog post. 

I'm unsure of the frequency of the blogs and when they will release but more than likely I will post something when I find something that I need
to remember, relearn, find interesting, or if I need to bounce ideas around. By no means am I an expert, professional or someone you should
look too, but maybe watching me trip and fall will help you learn to tread a steadier path.

Thanks,
